# UnityAWS-Integration
Contains the AWS SDK version 3.7 (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net) bundled as a UnityPackage with the required Asmdef file for easy use with Unity.

This repo is provided as a part of my book, "Building Multiplayer Games in Unity using Mirror Networking by Dylan Engelbrecht". If you stumbled upon 
this repo by accident, consider watching the repo as I'll be updating the readme to include a link to the book once released.
